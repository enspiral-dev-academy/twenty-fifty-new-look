Some topics could not be addressed on a local level(e.g. bioenergy) but will play a large role in any potential pathway to meet our ambitious targets. For these topics modelling or data was downscaled.</p></div></article></section><section class="scrollable"><article><p>The purpose of the calculator is to build an energy pathway for Wellington that hits the 80% CO2 emission reduction target at the top of the page.
