<h1>Small-scale wind</h1><p>In 2007 the UK had almost no small-scale wind turbines.</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes no significant increase, with small-scale wind turbines having negligible impact on the UK's energy system or the landscape.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that capacity increases to 0.6 GW in 2020, delivering 1.3 TWh/y, and is sustained at that level to 2050. Today's roof-mounted micro-turbines (Figure 1) don't contribute significantly as they are simply too small. Let's therefore visualize levels 2, 3 and 4 in terms of mini-turbines (Figure 2). Each of these turbines produces an average output of 4000 kWh/y. Reaching level 2 requires the construction of about 325 000 turbines. That's roughly 1.5 mini-turbines per square kilometre of the UK.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes that capacity increases to 1.6 GW in 2020, delivering 3.5 TWh/y, and is sustained at that level to 2050. Roughly 875 000 mini-turbines are needed, 3.5 mini-turbines per square kilometre of the UK.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 4 assumes that capacity increases to 4.1 GW in 2020, delivering 8.9 TWh/y, and is sustained at that level to 2050. This corresponds to 2.2 million mini-turbines, nine mini-turbines per square kilometre of the UK. If we assume that each of those mini-turbines 'occupies' an area of 30 m Ã— 30 m, the area occupied at level 4 is 2000 km2, or nearly 1% of the UK.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Small-scale wind" src="/images/factsheets/small-scale-wind-img1.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1. A 5.5 m diameter Iskra 5-kW mini-turbine having its annual check-up.

For comparison, the average British person's share of electricity consumption is 17 kWh per day.</figcaption></figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Small-scale wind" src="/images/factsheets/small-scale-wind-chart.png" />
