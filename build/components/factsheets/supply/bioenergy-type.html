<h1>Type	of bioenergy</h1><p>The Calculator has two levers controlling the supply of bioenergy. The ‘Type of bioenergy’ lever allows the user to set a preference for whether the available biomass supply is converted to biogas or liquid biofuels, or used as solid biomass.  </p><h2>Option A</h2><Bioenergy>is prioritised to replace coal, then liquid fuels, then gaseous fuels.</Bioenergy><h2>Option B</h2><p>All biomass supply is in solid form. The assumed conversion efficiency is 100%. </p><h2>Option C</h2><p>All biomass supply is converted to liquid biofuels. The assumed conversion efficiency is 35%.</p><h2>Option D</h2><p>All biomass supply is converted to biogas. The assumed conversion efficiency is 60%.</p><h2>Interaction with other choices</h2><p>The ‘Biomass supply’ lever controls the gross supply available before any conversion or other losses. Note that the bioenergy conversion only applies to the supply determined by the ‘Biomass supply’ lever (assumed to be imported from outside Wellington city).  It does not apply to any locally produced bioenergy, such as biogas from waste. </p>
