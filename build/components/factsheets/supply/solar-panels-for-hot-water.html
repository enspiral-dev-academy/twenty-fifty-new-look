<h1>Solar panels for hot water</h1><p>Solar water heating systems (also known as ‘solar thermal’) use solar panels to warm water which is stored in a hot water cylinder. In 2012 an estimated 2% of Wellington households had solar hot water systems, with an assumed average panel area of 5.3m². </p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes that 2% of Wellington households continue to have solar hot water. The non-residential sector introduces solar hot water which covers an area of 14,000 m² by 2050.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that by 2050, 9% of Wellington households have solar hot water. It also assumes that other (nonresidential)installations total 35,000 m2. At this level solar thermal delivers around 60 GWh/yr of heat</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes that by 2050, 28% of Wellington households have solar hot water and other (non-residential)installations total 52,500 m2.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>By 2050, 50% of Wellington households’ annual hot water demand is met by solar thermal.  Non-residential installations total 70,000 m2. Together level 4 delivers 242.9GWh/Y of heat energy</p><h2>Interaction with other choices</h2><p>Selecting level 4 on this lever at the same time as selecting level 4 on the ‘Solar panels for electricity’ lever may yield an unrealistic result, as the two will be competing for roof space. </p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Solar panels for hot water" src="/images/factsheets/solar-panels-for-hot-water-img.png" /></figure>
