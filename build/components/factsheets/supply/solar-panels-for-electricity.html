<h1>Solar panels for electricity</h1><p>In 2012, Wellington City produced an estimated 2 GWh of electricity through the use of solar photovoltaic panels (‘solar PV’). This assumes 1.5% of households had solar PV panels, which covered an average area of 5.3 m² per household. The total area of solar PV panels on commercial buildings was assumed to be 1000 m².</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes that the fraction of Wellington households with solar PV panels stays constant at 1.5%, while other non-residential installations total 15,000 m². This would more than triple the current amount of electricity produced by solar PV. </p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that by 2050, 11% of Wellington households have solar PV panels, and that other installations total 36,000 m2.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that by 2050, 25% of Wellington households have solar PV panels and other installations total 53,500 m2.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>By 2050, 50% of Wellington households have solar PV panels and otherinstallations total 71,000 m2.</p><h2>Interactions with other choices</h2><p>Selecting level 4 on this lever at the same time as selecting level 4 on the ‘Solar panels for hot water’ lever may yield an unrealistic result, as the two will be competing for roof space. </p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Solar panels for electricity" src="/images/factsheets/solar-panels-for-electricity-img.png" /></figure>
