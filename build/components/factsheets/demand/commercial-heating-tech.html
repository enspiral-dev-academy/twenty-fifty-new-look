<h1>Commercial heating technology</h1><p>This lever determines the mix of technologies to provide the commercial space and water heating demand. In 2012, we estimate that 53% of space heating was provided by electric heat sources (resistance heaters and heat pumps), 36% from gas heaters and boilers, and 11% from others. For water heating, 58% was electric, 32% gas, and the 10% from others.</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>At level 1 the space and water heating technology mix is assumed to be unchanged from today.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes all new commercial buildings use electric space and water heating, primarily heat pumps.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes the same as Level 2, plus half of current non-electric heating is converted to heat pump. </p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 4 assumes all non-electric heating is converted to heat pumps by 2050.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Commercial heating technology" src="/images/factsheets/commercial-heating-tech-img-1.png" /></figure><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Commercial heating technology" src="/images/factsheets/commercial-heating-tech-img-2.png" /></figure>
