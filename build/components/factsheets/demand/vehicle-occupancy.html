<h1>Vechicle occupancy</h1><p>In 2012, the average number of passengers per car, bus and train were estimated at 1.54, 25 and 104 respectively. Train occupancies are assumed not to change at all levels.</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes the average number of passengers per vehicle stays at current levels to 2050 for all modes.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that the average number of passengers per bus increases to 40 from 2020 onward, due to the introduction of higher capacity buses. No change in car occupancy.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes the same increase in bus occupancy as Level 2, and that increased ridesharing raises the number of passengers per car to 2.5 by 2040 before plateauing.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 4 assumes that bus occupancy continues increasing to 60 by 2050, while car occupancy increases faster to hit 2.5 by 2035, before plateauing.</p><h2>Interaction with other choices</h2><p>In the Calculator, energy demand for passenger transport is determined by multiple factors: travel demand; mode share (determined by the public transport and active transport levers); vehicle occupancies (described here); electrification of vehicles (with separate levers for private vehicles and public transport); and vehicle fuel efficiencies. Travel in and out of Wellington by plane and ferry are dealt with separately. Biofuels can be chosen as a supply option.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Vechicle occupancy" src="/images/factsheets/vechicle-occupancy-img.png" /></figure>
