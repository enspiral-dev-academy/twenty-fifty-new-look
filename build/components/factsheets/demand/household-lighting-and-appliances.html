<h1>Home lighting and appliances</h1><p>This sector considers energy used for lighting and appliances (e.g. fridges, computers, televisions) in households.</p><p>Note that at all levels, energy demand for cooking is fixed and assumed to grow with the number of households. Electrification of cooking is controlled by a separate lever. Excluding cooking, the electricity demand in 2012 is estimated at roughly 4,100 kWh per household.</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes electricity demand per household stays constant at the 2012 level. </p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that electricity demand per household reduces to 33% below the 2012 level by 2050.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes that electricity demand per household reduces to 50% below the 2012 level by 2050.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 3 assumes that electricity demand per household reduces to 67% below the 2012 level by 2050.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Energy	demanded	by	home	lighting	and	appliances" src="/images/factsheets/household-lighting-and-appliances-img.png" /></figure>
