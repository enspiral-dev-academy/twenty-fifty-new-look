<h1>Average temperature of homes</h1><p>The average internal temperature of UK homes during the winter months was 17.5&deg;C in 2007, compared to 16&deg;C in 1990. Almost no homes had air conditioning. Historically, the temperature people choose to heat their homes to has increased over the years.</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes that the average internal temperature of UK homes during the winter months continues to increase to 20&deg;C in 2030, then stabilises. Use of air conditioning grows to 50 TWh/y in 2050.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that the average temperature increases slightly to 18&deg;C in 2050. Use of air conditioning grows to 31 TWh/y in 2050.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes that the average temperature decreases slightly to 17&deg;C in 2050. Use of air conditioning grows to 14 TWh/y in 2050.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 4 assumes that the average temperature decreases to 16&deg;C in 2050, which is equivalent to the average internal house temperature in 1990. There is no use of air conditioning in the summer.</p><p>Reducing the average temperature of homes need not imply any loss of thermal comfort for householders. Energy can be saved by heating rooms only when they are occupied by the use of thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs), currently estimated to be deployed in around 55% of homes with a boiler. More sophisticated options, such as remote controls and sensors that respond to building occupancy, offer more possibilities.</p><p>More direct behaviour changes would also achieve a similar effect. For example, using a13 TOG winter duvet rather than a 12 TOG one offers the same level of thermal comfort in a house with a 1.5&deg;C lower internal temperature. Similarly, wearing one extra layer of clothing can compensate for a 1.5&deg;C drop in temperature.</p><p>For an older home that is otherwise maintained at 17.5&deg;C, an alternative to reducing the temperature by 1.5&deg;C is to leave it unheated for two or three additional hours per day.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Average temperature of homes chart" src="/images/factsheets/average-temperature-of-homes-chart1.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1.
