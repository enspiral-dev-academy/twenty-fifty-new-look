<h1>Vehicle efficiencies</h1><p>This lever determines the vehicle efficiencies (fuel consumed per vehicle-kilometre) for all modes and vehicle technologies. </p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes that all vehicle efficiencies do not change from their present values.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes a 10% improvement in efficiency for light vehicles and a 5% improvement for buses and trains by 2050.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes a 20% improvement in efficiency for light vehicles and a 10% improvement for buses and trains by 2050.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 4 assumes major efficiency improvements by 2050: around 70% for conventional light vehicles, 40% for electric cars, 30% for buses and trains.</p><h2>Interaction with other choices</h2><p>Other transport levers determine how much travel is done by light vehicle, bus and train, and the uptake of electric vehicles. Biofuels are chosen separately as a supply option.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Vehicle efficiencies" src="/images/factsheets/vehicle-efficiencies-img.png" /></figure>
